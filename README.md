# Chronic_Kidney_Disease_Prediction

- I pre-processed the data followed by data visualization, feature engineering, feature selection, standardization, and building models. Random Forest Model get higher accuracy and AUC score than other model. I also made an Webapp using Heroku.
- Link for Webapp: https://chronic-kidney-detection-ml.herokuapp.com/

**Libraries I used:**
- sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

**Model Builded:**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
